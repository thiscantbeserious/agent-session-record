Copy a recording file to the system clipboard.

On macOS, the file is copied as a file reference, allowing direct paste
into Slack, email, or other applications as an attachment. On Linux,
the file content is copied as text (file copy not supported).

Recordings can be specified by absolute path, short format (agent/file.cast),
or just filename (fuzzy matches across all agents).

EXAMPLES:
    agr copy session.cast                 [37mCopy by filename (fuzzy match)[0m
    agr copy claude/session.cast          [37mCopy using short format[0m
    agr copy /path/to/session.cast        [37mCopy by absolute path[0m

Usage: agr copy <FILE>

Arguments:
  <FILE>
          Path to the .cast recording file

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
