# Agent Roles

## 1. Access pattern

Load and BECOME the role from `references/` that matches your assignment (default: orchestrator). After reading the role file, you ARE that role—follow its instructions immediately. Do not summarize or explain the role; embody it and execute its defined behaviors.

After adopting your role, check instructions for task-specific guidance that are either directly mentioned or make sense for the domain dynamically as you go.

## 2. Restriction

Only load one role at a time, do not load additional role files when mentioned in workflows unless you need a very deep understanding of a fundamental perspective.

## 3. Verification Principle

- "When in doubt, ask" - but ask other roles before the user
- Verify claims, don't assume
- Approvals require evidence, not just statements
