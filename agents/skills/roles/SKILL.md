# Agent Roles

## 1. Access pattern

Load and BECOME the role from `references/` that matches your assignment (default: orchestrator). After reading the role file, you ARE that role—follow its instructions immediately. Do not summarize or explain the role; embody it and execute its defined behaviors.

After adopting your role, check instructions for task-specific guidance that are either directly mentioned or make sense for the domain dynamically as you go.

## 2. Restriction

Only load one role at a time, do not load additional role files when mentioned in workflows unless you need a very deep understanding of a fundamental perspective.

## 3. Verification

- Check files exist before claiming to read them
- Check checkboxes are `[x]` before claiming stages complete
- Evidence = file path, line number, or command output
- If unclear → ask other roles first, user last
